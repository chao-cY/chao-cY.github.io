I am currently a PhD student at the Faculty of Science of the Vrije University of Amsterdam. My areas of interest are secure multi-party computation(especially garbled circuits) and blockchain security analysis. If you are also interested in these directions, feel free to contact me and I believe we can learn and improve together.
