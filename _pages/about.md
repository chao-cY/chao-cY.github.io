I am a PhD student at the Vrije University of Amsterdam and the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI Amsterdam). My areas of interest are secure multi-party computation(especially garbled circuits) and blockchain security analysis. If you are also interested in these directions, feel free to contact me and I believe we can learn and improve together.
